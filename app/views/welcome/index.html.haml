        %h4 Give Life Back To Music
        %p Give life back to the music.  CeeDee builds on the boring, text-based CD databases of years past and attempts to provide elegant solution to the problem of ever-growing music libraries.  Accessible from any modern web browser, CeeDee moves as fast as its users.  Weâ€™re here for you when you need us.

        %h4 Integration
        %p With the help of the Spotify API, we are excited to present added details that make CeeDee stand out from alternative music database solutions.  From album name auto-completion to detailed music meta-data, CeeDee not only tracks music collections through a text database, but also presents album art, track numbers, and track lengths to the user, building a positive experience of human-database interaction.

        %h4 Power Without The Price
        %p CeeDee works with a database seamlessly.  We eliminated the need for any ugly search fields, and a user navigating through the site queries the database automatically behind-the-scenes.  We hide the implementation, and only show the user what they want to see.  CeeDee gives the user the option to easily select a user account to view, and options to sort music collections by album name, artist name, genre, and release year.
